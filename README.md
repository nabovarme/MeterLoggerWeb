# MeterLoggerWeb

MeterLoggerWeb is the backend system for MeterLogger

## Build details

docker compose up --build

To initialize db (only do it first time!):

docker exec -it db /nabovarme_setup.sh

docker cp mysql_backup.sql.bz2 db:/tmp/

docker exec -it db /nabovarme_import.sh

docker exec -it db /nabovarme_triggers.sh


## Built-in / Static Variables
These are computed directly in Perl without querying other tables:

Symbolic Variable	Meaning
$serial	The serial number of the meter
$info	The info field from the meters table
$offline	Number of seconds since the meter last sent a sample (now - last_updated)
$id	ID of the alarm (used mostly in messages, not for logic)
$default_snooze	Default snooze time for this alarm

## Dynamic Sample-Based Variables
These values are fetched from the latest 5 rows of the samples_cache table for the given serial and median is calculated:

Symbolic Variable	Meaning
$energy	Median of last 5 values from samples_cache.energy
$volume	Median of last 5 values from samples_cache.volume
$kwh_left	Median of last 5 values from samples_cache.kwh_left
$valve_status	Median (numeric) of last 5 values from samples_cache.valve_status
... (others)	Any other column in samples_cache may be referenced similarly
âœ… You can use any column name from samples_cache as $your_column, and the system will replace it with the median of the last 5 values.

## Recently Added
These are special variables computed based on comparisons:

Symbolic Variable	Meaning
$last_volume	The most recent volume value before the last check, stored per alarm
(coming soon)	You could similarly add $last_energy, etc., if needed
